# IOT-based_smart_green_house

This project showcases an IoT-based smart greenhouse system designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The aim is to create an automated environment that optimizes plant growth by monitoring and controlling various parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity.

**Features**
**Real-Time Monitoring:** Sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions within the greenhouse.

**Automated Control:** The system automatically adjusts watering, heating, and lighting based on sensor data.

**Remote Access:** Users can remotely access the greenhouse data and control systems via a web interface.

**Alerts and Notifications:** The system sends alerts for unusual conditions, ensuring timely intervention.

**Installation and Setup**
* Clone the repository.
* Open the project in Cisco Packet Tracer.
* Configure the IoT devices and sensors according to the provided schematic.
* Run the simulation to observe the smart greenhouse in action.
  
**Future Work:**
* Integrate machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
  
* Expand the system to include more advanced environmental controls.
  
* Develop a mobile application for easier management and notifications.
